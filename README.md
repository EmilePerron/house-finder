# Emile's House Search

This is a very simple and scraping script I built for the most popular house listing websites in Lac-Saint-Jean, QC, Canada.  
I built it when I was in the market for a house, as I didn't want to browse every housing marketplace every day to see what new listings had been posted.

This script simply scraped those websites and sent me email notifications containing the new listings that might be of interest.

Please note that it wasn't built to be entirely customizable: I built this fairly quickly, so you might have to adjust a few things if you want to use it.
